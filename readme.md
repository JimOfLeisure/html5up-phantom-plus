An attempt to eliminate jQuery from [HTML5UP's Phantom theme](https://html5up.net/phantom).

## Status

Just getting started.

## Folder structure

- html5up-phantom - The verbatim theme files from [HTML5UP's Phantom theme](https://html5up.net/phantom)
- vanillajs - Same folder structure as html5up-phantom, but only includes files changed from the original distribution
- dist (untracked by git) - Eventually a build script will take the needed files from the original theme and the updated files from vanillajs to be a deployable theme, but for now I'm just manually copying and/or linking files in there during development.
