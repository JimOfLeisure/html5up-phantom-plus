# [HTML5UP's Phantom theme](https://html5up.net/phantom)

The contents of html5up/phantom is [HTML5UP's Phantom theme](https://html5up.net/phantom), unaltered.

## Ports of HTML5UP Phantom

The `main` branch of this repo is a modified version of this theme that
removes jQuery and other libraries and replicates their functionality with
updated vanilla JavaScript and CSS.

I intend to port this to React and have branches of this repo for new Create
React App, Gatsby, and Next.js new project skeletons with the HTML5UP Phantom
theme installed.

Here are the currently available completed branches:

- `main` - The vanilla JS update of the original
- `gatsby` - A new Gatsby site repo with a Phantom-derived theme
- `original` - This branch - For convenience, the original theme is in the `original` branch.
